              4.3 In some cases, financial instruments may only be traded during the time when the relevant exchange is open (“Limited Trading Hours”). Where your Contract relates to such financial instruments, we shall not be obliged to quote prices

              such Contracts at any time, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of which of your Contracts may be affected.

              passwords are kept secure and strictly confidential at all times. You agree not to disclose any such access details and/or passwords to any party without our prior consent.
              <br><br>
              7.2 We shall be entitled to act upon any instructions or orders that purport to be sent by or from you using the online trading systems and we shall have no responsibility to monitor or verify any such instructions or orders in any way.
              Once given instructions or orders may only be withdrawn or amended with our prior consent. You accept that we shall at no time be required to accept any instructions or orders from you that are not sent using the relevant online trading
              system. This shall be the case notwithstanding any delay or malfunction of the online trading systems or otherwise.
              <br><br>
              7.3 We may at our absolute discretion refuse to accept or act in accordance with any instructions or orders, without being under any obligation to give any reasons. If we decline an instruction or order we will take reasonable steps to
              notify you promptly of this but subject to this will not be liable for any failure to accept or act on such instruction or order.
              <br><br>
              7.4 The online trading systems made available for your use are provided by third party providers whom we have requested to provide such services. Your use of such online trading systems is therefore subject to the relevant third
              parties’ terms in respect of such usage. You agree not to use the online trading systems for any purpose other than entering into bona fide transactions and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In particular, you
              shall not attempt in any way to modify, copy, disrupt or interfere in any way with the software underlying the online trading systems. You agree to indemnify us for any loss, expense or damages (including reasonable legal costs) arising
              out of any claim that a relevant third party may bring against us if you breach the terms of this clause. We shall be entitled to withhold and/or set out any amount held on your account or due to you against any liability we may
              reasonably believe may be or become due to us in respect of the above indemnity.
              <br><br>
              7.5 You accept that you are responsible for keeping track and acting upon key dates, times and events in respect of any Contract.

              7.6 You acknowledge and accept that trades are executed in real time and as such we cannot be held responsible for any error or mistake incurred as a consequence of your act or omissions.
              <br><br>
              7.7 You will be dealing with us on an execution-only basis in reliance solely on your own judgement. In this regard you should bear in mind that if we merely explain the terms of an investment or its performance characteristics this
              does not of itself amount to advice on the merits of a transaction in the investment or on the legal or tax status or consequences.
              <br><br>
              7.8 Instructions or orders must arrive in our possession before we can act on them.
              <br><br>
              7.9 As explained in clause 7.4, the online trading systems made available for your use are provided by third party providers whom we have requested to provide such services. Accordingly we cannot guarantee the operation or integrity of
              the online trading systems. There may be delays or malfunctions in the online trading systems. This could, for example, prevent you being able to close out or execute a transaction. By entering into these terms and/or trading with us,
              you acknowledge that we are not responsible for the online trading systems and hold us harmless against any loss you may suffer as a result of your usage of the online trading systems (including, without limitation, any trading losses
              suffered and any loss of profits or opportunities).
              <br><br>
              7.10 You shall promptly (and within any time limit imposed by us) give any further instructions to us which we may reasonably request from you in respect of any transactions or other matters in relation to which we have accepted your
              instructions to act. If you do not do so, we may in our sole discretion take any steps at your cost which we consider appropriate for our or for your protection.
              <br><br>
              7.11 If we advise you that we consider an investment decision to be unsuitable but you still wish to execute a transaction based on that decision, we will only accept the instruction on an ‘execution-only’ basis.

              8.1.1 we may accept payments into the Account in different currencies and any payments due to or from us and any net balances on the Account shall be reported by us in the respective currency; The account is maintained in the currency
              selected by you pursuant to this Agreement and which, in the absence of a selection, shall be £ pound sterling (“Base Currency”) and any other currency will be converted at the exchange rate existing at the point of conversion
              (“Exchange Rate”);
              <br><br>
              8.1.2 you accept that when you enter into one or more Contracts denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency, a currency ledger will be created on the Account and will remain until all Contracts in such currency are closed.
              You will receive or pay interest to us for any credit or debit balance separately for each currency ledger;
              <br><br>
              8.1.3 we shall additionally report all sums due to or from us, whether by way of margin or otherwise, and the net balance on the Account in the Base Currency using the Exchange Rate;
              <br><br>
              8.1.4 we will generally settle trades in the relevant currency where the Account comprises such currency ledger, save that where such currency balance is insufficient, we may settle trades in any currency for which there is a currency
              ledger in the Account using the Exchange Rate; and
              <br><br>
              8.1.5 unless we agree otherwise, withdrawals from the Account may only be made in the same currency in which the respective deposit was made.
              <br><br>
              8.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if you have more than one Account with us, these will be treated entirely separately. Therefore, any credit on one Account (including monies deposited as margin) will not
              discharge your liabilities in respect of another Account unless we exercise our rights under this Agreement.
              <br><br>
              8.3 It is your responsibility to maintain your Account at all such times. This includes ensuring that the required level of margin is in place. If you have more than one Account, this responsibility will relate to each Account
              separately, unless we have agreed otherwise in writing with you.
              <br><br>
              8.4 Except in the case of fraud, we do not accept responsibility for any loss or damage suffered by you as a result of your trading on monies deposited in or credited to your Account in error by or upon your behalf.

              9.6 If you place an order for a Contract outside the Standard Trading Size, it may be subject to special conditions and requirements. We will notify you of these at the time of the order, in which case you shall not be obliged to
              proceed with the order.
              <br><br>
              9.7 It is possible that Pricing Errors and/or delays may occur in the prices of Contracts quoted by us. In such circumstances, without prejudice to any rights either we or you may have under applicable law, neither you nor we will be
              bound by any Contract which purports to have been made (whether or not confirmed by us) at a price which was, or ought reasonably to have been, known to either you or us to be materially incorrect or outdated at the time of the
              Contract. The party asserting that the Contract is avoided under this clause shall give notice to the other within five (5) business days (meaning Monday to Friday excluding bank or public holidays (“Business Days”)) of the Contract.
              “Pricing Error” is defined as a misquote by us where: (a) the price quoted materially deviates from the prevailing market price (or the forward calculated market price) at the time that it was quoted. A material deviation is defined,
              but not exclusively, as a Bid Price or Offer Price which varies above or below the prevailing mid-market price of the underlying Product by more than the size of the quoted bid/offer spread of that Product. For example a bid/offer quote
              by us in the EUR/USD contract of 1.3912 – 1.3914 when the correct quote should have been 1.3908 – 1.3910 may be considered by us to be a Pricing Error as our Bid of 1.3912 is more than the quoted spread of the product (in this case 2)
              away from the midpoint (1.3909) of the correct quote; or (b) the price quote varies from the prevailing market price due to technological problems including without limit delays in the transmission of electronic data and/or corrupt
              data.
              <br><br>
              9.8 Except in the case of fraud, we do not accept any liability for any loss or damage suffered by you as a result of your reliance on a price which you knew, or ought reasonably to have known, to be materially incorrect.

              Requirements may apply to different accounts and/or investments traded. You may be required by us to supplement such margin at any time when your Account shows a debit balance or an increase in your Margin Requirement. You will pay or

              11.8 You acknowledge and accept that we may at our absolute discretion allow you time to forward cleared funds to meet Margin Requirements. We shall be entitled (but not obliged) to make a request to you for any deposit or payment that
              you make or are required to make on your Account under the terms of this Agreement (“Margin Payments”) (“Margin Call”) before exercising our rights to close out Contracts. Notwithstanding the previous sentence we are obliged to close
              open Accounts if a Margin Call is not met with five (5) Business Days. Nothing in this clause shall prohibit or restrict us from closing or restricting any transactions if there are insufficient funds to meet Margin Requirements.
              <br><br>
              11.9 You agree to contact us immediately if you believe that you are or will be unable to make any Margin Payments. Failure to make a Margin Payment when due is an Event of Default. Due to the serious nature of failing to make Margin
              Payments when due you are strongly recommended to regularly monitor your Margin Requirement.
              <br><br>
              11.10 You waive any obligation on us to receive a margin demand, call or notice from us and accept that it is entirely your responsibility to monitor the Margin Requirement and make all necessary Margin Payments by the due date.
              <br><br>
              11.11 You agree that any transactions we effect for you will be subject to the rules regulations, customs and practices of each relevant market, exchange, or clearing house on, through or with which we deal.
